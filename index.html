   <h1>03 Displacements</h1>
<div>   
Why did you swayed away?
Beats echoed inside, resonated with the Play.
Oh you're cached everywhere.
When your tear took a slide,
-it too drenched me inside.
Peeped at you, the drizzle mizzled,
-drops still dripped, for I heard the fizzle.
You were weeping,
I was still leering.

She never went awry,
I had followed her trail,
Never did she ever gaze at me,
But I knew she was confiding to me.
She is a reflection, 
a reflection in the pond
But I was a silly man,
with a pebble in my hand.

<h1>02 Haven</h1>
<div>
Here I am without myself.
Strolling in sand, in gusty abandon. 
The wind has spurred,
spurred me-
to another dimension.

Why am I here, I questioned,
The desert uttered no answer.
I reach the haven,
calm, I give a serene smile.
Looked at my tread erstwhile.
The wind took my past away,
the imprint is just in my eyes,
-with those eyes I look,
-I look at the isle.

I bowl the water in,
Sumeet was gazing at me.
He wanted answers, 
-to the questions,
-that the wind,
-never let flee.

I felt empty and hollow,
void, yet no sorrow.
I drink the water,
-for I was thirsty.
He gazes again,
-asks for what I desire?
Was the thought of water,
or for water itself I transpire?

I look at him in disgust.
He has descended,
-descended onto the heir of mistrust.
His stature has sank,
-sank with his physique
into the abyss of conceit.

Marvelled in amaze,
I thought of the play,
-play that the desert had played.
Oh! The Desert has played it again,
-the desert of my brain.
The desert of my brain!

<h1>01 Limerences</h1>
<div>
Oh you dear El,
you have made me zestless piece of shit.
I spent years trying to prate,
your mixed expression, leaned me to fate
Your Aphrodisian beauty is what for I glimped,
I should better heed to Avogadro's constant.
Neither Medi., nor off jacked,
A quirk of you, and my cephal is soothed.
Please go away or just give a clue,
I can't live in blue,
I can't live in blues.

Alas! It was good whilst it lasted,
was it just a mirage, that I enlarged?
Short was the Tryst,
-showed me my needs and
no one gives a shit of other's deeds.
What a complex machine Sapien is,
impedes from the past memoirs,
shatters its own memoirs,
shatters its own memoirs.

What do I do?
I'm out of band-aids,
Is like walking on rakes.
The gist is it to forget,
walk away from the wine,
sour is the grape,
sour are the grapes.
